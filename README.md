Collaboration project between California State University, Los Angeles and City of LA, Bureau of Engineering. The goal in task for this project is to assist them to identify, monitor, and speed up the process of sidewalk restoration to ensure its ADA compliancy. Therefore, the Sidewalk project has been aiming to build a functioning rover that will be an efficient tool for the field crew of city officials. The rover is expected to roll on the sidewalks and measure its slope while collecting data such as images and GPS coordinates. 

## Task 2: Image Processing
Goal: Find the horizontal and vertical displacements of sidewalk with an image. Functionality for a running rover to detect and measure these displacements.
